  //console.log(this); //the 'this' keyword is pointed to the created object with the data  Object { firstName: "Jonas", birthYear: 1991 }..all the created objects

  // Never to this!   instance method    this is not good practice  b/c if wer have 1000 objects  the we will make 1000 methods   but we will fix this in next leacture using prototype
  // this.calcAge = function () {

Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
km/h
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
and log the new speed to the console
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
the new speed to the console
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and
'brake' multiple times on each of them

// important note about classes

//1. classes is not hoisted
//2. classes are first-class citzens this means we can pass them to functions and return them from functions
//3. classes is excuted in strict mode

////SETTERS AND GETTERS
// every object in java script  can have setter and getters fetures but not that importnat   check video 211

///////static method

//The static keyword defines a static method or property for a class. Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class.
// Instead, they're called on the class itself.

//The static keyword  is methods  that is only related or linked to the specific classs or the constructor function   they are not for the created objected becouse they are not exists in thier prototype

//eg  of stattic is  like  Array.from()  that is only accesd to the Array constractor ity self  they are not on the prototype so  arrays cant acess it

//Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('h1')); //[h1]
//but not worked on the other arrays

//[1, 2, 3].from(); // so get type error

//another eg
console.log(Number.parseFloat(12)); //12   this is static  spcific  to the "Number" constractor  not to another numbers
//but not for the below
//console.log('20'.parseFloat()); //"20".parseFloat is not a function

/*Static methods are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects, 
whereas static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, 
or any other data you don't need to be replicated across instances.*/

  //static method and static prperty
